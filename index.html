<!--TWO DIFF SCRIPT CODES-->

<html>


  <script>
//can tell it to wait until everything has been loaded in.
// The command for that is 'window.onload'. We say '= function()'. And what this is going to do, it's
//fxn is ran once everything is loaded.
//  And what is going to happen, is it sees this window.onload and says, This won't be executed until
// everything down here has loaded
    window.onload = function () {
      const slot = document.getElementById("tag1");
      //Time gets injected
      var time = 100;
      //we will have a fxn get time
      var getTime= ()=>{
        time = time - 1;
        slot.innerHTML = "Hello World, here's a timer countdown from " + time + ` secs`;
      }
    //  have a timer called setInterval
      setInterval(getTime, 500);
    };
  </script>


<!--Beware of order of code being executed before code becomes into existance!!-->

  <body>
    <div>
      <h1 id="tag1">Hello Earthling</h1>
    </div>
  </body>

<!--<script>-->
<!--// First we entered a script tag & get ahold of element by id&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--  const tag = document.getElementById('tag1')-->
<!--//we can modify the inner HTML-->
<!--//hello... -> goodbye ...-->
<!--tag.innerHTML = 'Goodbye Aliens'-->
